			<p>As a railfan, I have been dreaming to create a personal website to introduce China Railway (CR) and to archive my train travels. Fortunately, SI539 provides such a precious opportunity for me to carry out my plan.</p>
			<p>This website focuses on presenting several aspects of CR, including trains, routes, and tickets.</p>

			<p>CR owns the largest passenger train network in the world, which is still growing at a fantastic speed. Its routes spread across all provinces of China, sending billions of passengers to their destination every year. In recent 15 years, high speed trains have been introduced and gradually becomes the major selection of travel, whose top speed can reach 350 km/h.</p>
