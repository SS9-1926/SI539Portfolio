		<p>CR has the second largest rail network in the world. Different from America, most of the routes allow passenger trains. Normal railway lines allow both passenger trains and freight trains. High speed routes, also called as Gao Tie, only allow high speed trains. There are also a small number of railway lines specially designed for freight trains.<p>

			The above map is about the railway routes and their mileage. It is fantastic, isn't it? When conductor sells pass tickets, they will often refer to this map. What is a pass ticket? Please kindly refer to the Ticket page.
